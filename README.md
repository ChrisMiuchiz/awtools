# awtools

## Overview

This is a work-in-progress set of third-party tools for ActiveWorlds online services, including a Universe server which can be used with existing World servers. This targets ActiveWorlds major versions 4 and 5.

## Motivation

This work exists primarily to support the restoration of Miuchiz Planet Mion, an ActiveWorlds Universe which existed between 2006 and 2012. The latest clients distributed with Miuchiz were version 4.1, builds 965 through 981. As such, the specific implementations of these tools are designed to support these final Miuchiz clients.
